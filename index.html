        <h4>Hazel</h4>
        <h4 class="stars">★★★★★</h4>
        <p>It's seems like some people ask for a couple of inches when they want an inch, so I'll say here, Kim is a
          five star salonist. Very accommodating and skilled, I've never left here unhappy or with a bad haircut,
          whether I ask for something specific or I just ask for a trim. I went to a very expensive haircut elsewhere
          that I was thrilled with, but lasted a week, before I needed to come back to Kim to get my hair cut as I
          like.<br><br>Services: Haircut<br><br>Google Link: <a

        <h4>Michaelyn</h4>
        <h4 class="stars">★★★★</h4>
        <p>I've been here three times now. Every time, Kim was the stylist who colored and cut my hair. I have never
          left here feeling upset, angry, or disappointed. It's the only place I can call and get same day service or
          next day service. Most other places are booked a month or more out. (Good or bad thing, you decide) I like to
          think of this place as a hidden gem or a really good kept secret. All three times I've wanted to lighten my
          hair from light brown to super light, almost platinum blonde. One visit, she gets it done. Little to no damage
          to my hair. So either I'm really lucky or she's really good at her job lol.<br><br> I was nervous at first bc
          I was used to very high end salons in Beverly Hills, CA and this place is small and she may ask u to brush ur
          own hair lol, but overall, especially for the price you pay, and that's not to say u get what u pay for, I'm
          saying that you get more than what u pay for here. <br><br>The price is just an added bonus, I feel
          comfortable recommending this salon to any woman looking to clean-up, touch-up, or completely change their
          look. There is a small language barrier, so be very specific of what you want. I've never asked for anything
          technically crazy, like a Bayalage or ombre, so I can't speak on that. As far as cut, she's never taken off
          more than I asked. Every single place I've ever been to has taken off so much more length than I wanted. My
          sister didn't have the same experience here in regard to cutting length off, so I cannot stress enough that
          YOU HAVE TO BE VERY SPECIFIC. <br><br>Don't say a couple inches, say one inch. Or half inch. Specifically say,
          do not cut more than one inch or so on and so forth. I feel like most stylists are going to take off all of or
          as much of the damaged hair as they can if you're not specific and say I don't care if its damaged 😂
          anyway... It may not be top of the line, but I always leave happy and end up getting TONS of compliments on my
          hair!<br><br>Services: Haircut, Hair coloring, Bang trim, Hair highlighting <br><br>Google Link: <a
